Week1

#1 I read the paper "Computer programming as an art" and I developed new insights into how computer programming can be seen as an art
   not just a scientific field of study.
#2 I looked into an upcoming language called 'Rust',that seeks to add more sefety features into traditional programming languages like C and C++.
