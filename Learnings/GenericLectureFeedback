#1 Lectures are interesting,but mostly just scratch the surface. I am not really learning anything concrete through them.
#2 Would like to know  when would we actually begin  working on languages belonging to different paradigms,not just the languages assigned to us. 
#3 It would be really helpful to us if you could take a set of lectures on interpreters.
